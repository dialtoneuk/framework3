Framework 3 is the new and improved version of Framework 2. While currently in **beta**, it still has a long way to go in terms of development
as well as making the payload easier to install. It has a hybrid MVC controller, super simple RESTless ( ajax friendly ) support, multiple login
gates done easy and comes packed with Bootstrap. While it does have a steep learning curve, I use it for all of my projects.

# Installation

Framework 3 cannot currently be installed via composer due to the front-end payload it holds. When installing Framework 3, you must download
it directly from github.

- Download Framework 3 from github.
- Run composer install in the same direction as composer.json.
- Begin programming!

# Documentation

I've not had time to write documentation for this yet, but I have included some example files and heavily documented my code in each file. Its
the best I can do for now.
